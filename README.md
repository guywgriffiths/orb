# Orb

Orb is a USB powered LED lamp with an embedded microcontroller that allows it to be controlled remotely over wifi using HTTP and MQTT. The controller is a Wemos D1 mini that utilises an ESP 8266. 

The USB-A socket can be used to switch USB powered devices on and off such as lamps and fans. It also has a piezo-electric buzzer. Additionally it has an RF 433Mhz reciever that can be dynamically configured to control the devices functions using many EV1527 4CH transmitters.


Here's the a picture of the first Orb.

Below is a screen shot taken from an iPhone showing the Web page served up from the embedded HTML server.

It's designed to look like an old style TV remote control.

I'll post the mircocontroller C++ code once I've cleaned it up to remove the obsolete bits.
